## üìö About

This repository contains Python codes done in college as part of coursework and practice. It is organized to separate formal assignments from day-to-day class work, making it easy to navigate, learn, and reference.

- Owner: @ujwwal
- Language: Python
- Description: ‚Äúpython codes done in the college‚Äù

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner revising fundamentals or a peer looking for examples, you‚Äôll find neatly organized scripts and notes here.

---

## üóÇ Repo Structure

A quick look at the top-level layout:

```text
BVIMR_python/
‚îú‚îÄ Assignments/       # Graded tasks, problem statements, and their solutions
‚îú‚îÄ Class Work/        # In-class demos, practice scripts, and notes
‚îî‚îÄ example.txt        # Example placeholder file
```

Direct links:
- Assignments: [Assignments/](Assignments/)
- Class Work: [Class%20Work/](Class%20Work/)
- Example: [example.txt](example.txt)

> Tip: File names inside each folder are self-explanatory (e.g., topic-based or date-based). Browse the folder that matches what you‚Äôre looking for.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the code running locally:

1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujwwal/BVIMR_python.git
cd BVIMR_python
```

2) (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# Create venv (Windows)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Create venv (macOS/Linux)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3) Install any dependencies (if a requirements file is added later)
```bash
# Only if requirements.txt exists
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üß™ How to Use

- Run a specific Python script (replace with an actual filename in the folder):
```bash
# Example (Windows PowerShell)
python ".\Class Work\hello_world.py"

# Example (macOS/Linux; note the space in the folder name)
python "./Class Work/hello_world.py"
```

- Explore assignments:
  - Open [Assignments/](Assignments/) and run the script you want to test.
  - Read any accompanying comments or docstrings for problem statements.

- Explore class work:
  - Open [Class%20Work/](Class%20Work/) for topic-wise examples and quick demos.

---

## üéØ Learning Topics

The repository focuses on core Python skills typically covered in college coursework:

- Python basics: variables, input/output, operators
- Control flow: conditionals, loops
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- Error handling (try/except)
- Intro to OOP: classes and objects
- Basic algorithms and problem-solving patterns
- Optional extensions (as they appear): NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, web requests

As the repo grows, topics will be grouped and labeled more clearly.

---

## üìù Coding Style

- Clear names and comments over excessive cleverness
- Small, focused scripts that demonstrate one concept well
- Use docstrings where helpful to describe the task/solution approach

---

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome!

1) Fork the repo
2) Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/meaningful-name
```
3) Commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Add: brief description of the change"
```
4) Push and open a pull request

Please keep contributions educational and well-commented.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- Organize files by topic (e.g., basics, DS, OOP)
- Add a requirements.txt if external libraries are introduced
- Include problem statements alongside solutions where applicable
- Add sample inputs/outputs for select assignments
- Optional: Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
